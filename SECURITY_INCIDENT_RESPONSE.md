# Security Incident Response

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Credentials Exposed in Git History

**Date:** 2025-07-13  
**Issue:** Real username and password were accidentally committed to the public repository  
**Commit:** ffc2b7a  
**File:** test-api.js  
**Detection:** GitGuardian automated scan  

### Immediate Actions Taken:

1. ‚úÖ **Credential Removal**: Removed hardcoded credentials from test-api.js
2. ‚úÖ **Environment Variables**: Updated test file to use environment variables
3. ‚úÖ **Documentation Update**: Added security guidelines for testing
4. üîÑ **Git History**: Credentials remain in git history (commit ffc2b7a)

### Recommended Actions:

#### For Repository Owner:
1. **CHANGE PASSWORDS IMMEDIATELY** - The exposed credentials should be considered compromised
2. **Review Access Logs** - Check if the exposed credentials were used inappropriately
3. **Git History Cleanup** (Optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   # WARNING: This rewrites git history and affects all collaborators
   git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
     'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch test-api.js' \
     --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
   git push origin --force --all
   ```

#### For Development Team:
1. **Never commit real credentials** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for all sensitive data
3. **Use .env files** that are in .gitignore
4. **Enable pre-commit hooks** to scan for secrets
5. **Regular security audits** of repositories

### Prevention Measures Implemented:

1. **Test File Security**: Updated test-api.js to use environment variables
2. **Documentation**: Added clear instructions for secure testing
3. **Environment Example**: Updated .env.example with testing credentials section

### Future Security Measures:

1. Install and configure git hooks for secret scanning
2. Regular security audits of all code files
3. Team training on secure coding practices
4. Implement automated secret scanning in CI/CD pipeline
